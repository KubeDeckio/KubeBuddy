# Logging and Output

KubeBuddy provides concise console output and optional reports for deeper analysis. You can capture these outputs or generate reports to share with your team or review later.

## 1. Real-Time Console Output

When you run `Invoke-KubeBuddy`, progress and key findings appear directly in your console. Youâ€™ll see checks for:

- **Cluster health**
- **Security or RBAC warnings**
- **Any issues with pods or workloads** (if applicable)

To save console output to a file:

```powershell
Invoke-KubeBuddy | Out-File "KubeBuddyOutput.log"
```

## 2. Generating Reports

KubeBuddy can generate **HTML** or **text-based** reports. These typically include node health, workload issues, and any security alerts found during checks.

- **HTML Report:**

  ```powershell
  Invoke-KubeBuddy -HtmlReport
  ```
  
  This creates an HTML file (e.g., `kube_report.html`) you can open in a browser.

- **Text Report:**

  ```powershell
  Invoke-KubeBuddy -txtReport
  ```
  
  This creates a plain text file (e.g., `kube_report.txt`) which is handy for quick reference.

## 3. Completion Message

After checks finish, KubeBuddy prints a final message indicating the process has completed and, if applicable, confirms the report path. For example:

```
KubeBuddy has finished analyzing your cluster.
HTML report generated at /path/to/kube_report.html
```

This message provides a concise overview of what happened and where to find more details.

## 4. Common Error Messages

If an error occurs, KubeBuddy provides detailed messages to help you troubleshoot. Below are a few examples:

| Error Message                                                       | Meaning                                                                   | Solution                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ERROR: No clusters detected. Ensure you are connected to a cluster.` | KubeBuddy could not find an active Kubernetes context.                    | Use `kubectl config current-context` to confirm a valid cluster connection.                                      |
| `ERROR: Authentication required for Azure operations.`             | You are not logged into Azure for AKS checks.                             | Run `az login` and use `az account set --subscription <subscription-id>` to select the correct subscription.     |
| `ERROR: Kubectl not found in system PATH.`                         | `kubectl` is either not installed or not in your PATH environment.        | Install `kubectl` by following [the official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).           |
